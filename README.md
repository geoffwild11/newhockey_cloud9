# NEWHockey.com Website

## Current section of Rails Tutorial
- 3.2.2

## NorthEast Wisconsin Hockey
I'm creating this site for my own personal interest and growth. I love hockey, and I reall like webdev, so let's see about combining the two. 

## The NEWHockey.com's purpose
- Collect information on different games going on in the area
- Collect information on teams, rinks, and leagues in the area
- Eventually a blog with my stuff
- I would really like a way to show people how to get involved
- It would also be nice to drive some different causes to make hockey more accessible and affordable to anyone interested
